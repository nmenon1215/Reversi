Previous to this assignment, we wish we had made a 2-player game as a class invariant rather than
accounting for the possibility of 2+ player games to make our features interface easier to use. For
our view, we wish we implemented a keyListener properly and that clicking outside the cells worked
correctly. In our controller, we wish we implemented the feature's interface correctly instead of
just creating a couple of methods in the controller and model without a concrete interface. We
coupled our controller to our view a decent amount and would have made it more modular if done
differently. The primary thing we learned was how a features interface improves modularity. Next, we
found out how to implement the keyListener in the view instead of the controller. Overall, we
learned how to better support the MVC pattern and make each part of it only coupled to the other
parts where absolutely needed. Our experience with our providers was very beneficial to our
assignment. They were quick to respond, and we made a group chat where we could ask any questions we
had. They were also very knowledgeable of their code and could answer specific questions about it.
They were sure to update us with any additional changes they made to their code and to explain more
about their interfaces when we asked.
